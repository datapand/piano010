In my opinion, it is essential that those who practice piano as a hobby achieve a high level of proficiency, comparable to those who have chosen it as their profession. I firmly believe that everyone should have access to the right information and guidance.

Ambitious and talented students follow a university or master's level path at the conservatories after understanding the approach, artistry, and discipline to become professional pianists. Called a natural talent for teaching, even as a young piano teacher by my superiors, I have helped those audition for those institutes. You can find some testimonials on my artist web page.

My advanced classical piano students has included Liszt's 'La Campanella' in their repertoire, while other students have demonstrated their ability to tackle a diverse range of compositions, including works by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn Sonatas, Bach fugues and inventions, Chopin Ballades, Nocturnes, Waltzes, Mazurkas, and Etudes, as well as the complex compositions of Ibert, Debussy, Granados, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, among many others.

Interestingly, none of these students are studying at the conservatory; they have various professions or are enrolled in different university programs.


### Hobby & Professional

##### BOTH WORLDS OF PIANO PLAYING

Knowing well both worlds: the high-level professionals and amateur students!

During my 21 years of teaching experience, especially the 9 years I have worked at different music schools where I was teaching a weekly minimum of 30 people, I have spent half of my time "correcting" the technique and "filling the gaps" of missed information. 
​
Many students who have already had lessons for years got stuck at the upper intermediate level. They could not step up to advanced pieces, although they were passionate about those more challenging pieces.
​
I am a lucky pianist because I learned how to play the classical piano from great piano teachers such as David Ezra Okonsar and Aquiles delle Vigne. Having studied with one of the most respected piano teachers who has taught international competition winner pianists and at best positions as professional pianists worldwide, I got the chance to learn from classes other than my own.
​
Observing many high-level pianists and trying to help amateur piano players led me to identify the differences: I can see the technical problems and offer solutions.
