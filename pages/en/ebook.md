### Why does the Early Intermediate Piano Pieces e-Book matter?

As pianists progress, they often encounter a pivotal yet challenging transitional phase. This book curates a selection of meticulously chosen pieces, strategically crafted to practice skills necessary for overcoming obstacles commonly faced on the path toward higher-level piano playing and prevent the problems caused by prematurely transitioning to what is often mistakenly known as the 'intermediate' level.

> The intermediate stage is where challenges emerge, and pianists can feel stuck. It represents a crucial juncture in the pianist's evolution, demanding careful guidance and a well-crafted repertoire.

A holistic approach toward learning is crucial; therefore, selecting the right pieces plays a significant role. However, finding suitable transitional repertoire can be challenging due to under-listing or misclassification in educational materials.

> This curation allows players or their teachers to address challenges head-on and offers a seamless roadmap for progress. Concise yet informative annotations accompany every piece, guiding practice and unlocking its educational value.

Each composition has been rewritten and edited with a keen eye on enhancing visual clarity, maintaining adherence to music notation standards while integrating modernity.

> For both piano teachers and students, this book aims to provide assistance, facilitating a smooth transition from beginner to intermediate classical piano playing.
