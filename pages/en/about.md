Growing up in a family of accomplished musicians and educators provided a rare and high-quality foundation for my development as an educator from a young age. Early on, respected conservatory professors acknowledged not only my abilities as a pianist, but also my exceptional aptitude for teaching-feedback they shared with me personally and confirmed in writing when I assisted younger piano students in preparing for high school and bachelor-level piano exams. I took these comments seriously and have carried that confidence with me ever since.

For 22 years, I have worked as a piano teacher in the private sector, developing a passion for advancing students from hobbyists to those tackling virtuosic works such as Liszt’s La Campanella. Complex repertoire by Chopin, Beethoven, and others has become a hallmark of my students’ achievements. I take unconventional steps to help each student reach their highest potential, intentionally moving beyond traditional teaching methods for those who are truly ambitious. The results have been consistently remarkable.

### Professorship

Teaching and performing are distinct but equally valuable aspects of a musician’s career. Many artists who are active performers sometimes underestimate the art of teaching, viewing it as a secondary pursuit for those who are not often on stage. This is a misconception-even the greatest pianists dedicate time to teaching. The difference is that, one becomes more selective about whom to teach, seeking students who are truly committed and passionate.

### My adventure as a teacher

I have worked as a certified piano teacher since I was 21, though I began teaching as a stagiaire at 18. My experience spans various cities, including Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Arnhem, Haarlem, and also online in the United Kingdom and Turkey.

My first tutoring experience was at age 14, when I helped a friend three years younger than me pass her re-exams, allowing her to stay on course. She is now a professional teacher and pianist. 

Our school for learning classical piano was a very strict conservatory. You would start at a very young age, unlike music schools or conservatories in NL, but more like the schools in Russia. We had full-time training from the age of 11 and part-time before that. This kind of schooling meant we had a full day at school, listening to each other practice, and our class would be as crowded as an orchestra. So I already started observing what others were playing or practicing, comparing back then.

Therefore, I am naturally knowledgeable about a wide repertoire. Our teachers taught us how to choose repertoire from the age of 12, and we had piano repertoire literature lessons at age 13. These are uncommon qualities in many conservatory systems in the Netherlands, which accept more bachelor students and have fewer younger students. I was once asked about repertoire choice for a student playing Sonatinas or easy Haydn sonatas during a job interview, and I was surprised this was even a question. This made me realize that knowledge of repertoire and how to select pieces according to a student’s needs and motivation is less common among many pianists with different backgrounds. I feel very fortunate to have been surrounded by so many musicians from a very young age, having entered the conservatory at 9.

I also taught at the conservatory’s piano department during my bachelor stage. On so many levels, that kind of teaching is much easier because the students are already committed to classical music and have the discipline to practice many hours daily.

There is so much more to my teaching experience than I could fit on one page, but I hope this brief biography already gives you some idea.

Ultimately, what drives me most as a teacher is the joy of sharing, observing, seeing positive results in practice, and inspiring maximum development in students. Leading beginners in their discovery of musical knowledge is one passion; spotting exceptional talents and guiding them to a high level is another. I am also deeply committed to helping those who have learned incorrect technique or have gaps in their knowledge to correct and advance their playing.

### Talent

Naturally, I have come across students who prepared for auditions for Bachelor's at various conservatories. Although inspiring young professionals and training them to become pianists is a very noble task, I take more pride in trying to help amateurs reach their potential. 

After realizing how difficult for hobby players to reach a higher level and observing the deficiencies in teaching methods, I have dedicated my time to start researching better ways than on the market.
