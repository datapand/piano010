### Professorship

Teaching is very different from being on stage. Read on for the teacher profile and view the artistic profile with the external links at the bottom of the page.


### My adventure as a teacher

I have worked as a piano teacher since I was 21 in various cities, such as Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Arnhem, Haarlem, and also online in the United Kingdom and Turkey.

I love sharing, observing and seeing excellent results and inspiring for maximum development.

When I was a young teacher candidate, my pedagogy teachers told me I was talented in playing and teaching. I had my first tutoring experience when I was 14, helping a friend three years younger than me pass the re-exams that allowed her to stay on course. She is now a professional teacher and pianist. 
Our school for learning classical piano was a very strict conservatory. You would start at a very young age, unlike music schools or conservatories in NL but more like the schools in Russia. We had full-time training from the age of 11 and part-time before that. This kind of schooling meant we had a full day at school, listening to each other practice, and our class would be as crowded as an orchestra. So I already started observing what others were playing or practicing, comparing back then. 

I also taught young pianists during my bachelor stage. On so many levels, that kind of teaching is more straightforward because the students are already committed to classical music and have the discipline to practice many hours daily.



### Talent

Naturally, I have come across students who prepared for auditions for Bachelor's at various conservatories. Although inspiring young professionals and training them to become pianists is a very noble task, I take more pride in trying to help amateurs reach their potential. 

After realizing how difficult for hobby players to reach a higher level and observing the deficiencies in teaching methods, I have dedicated my time to start researching better ways than on the market.
