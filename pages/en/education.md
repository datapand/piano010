Recognizing that many individuals who struggle to play the piano quickly, as desired, and effortlessly, this is often due to improper techniques. Unfortunately, many learn from apps or instructors who are not qualified as pianists, and are often proficient in other instruments at an intermediate level. Fortunately, when taught by a skilled concert pianist, especially one with a classical background, students can quickly adapt and improve their skills.
