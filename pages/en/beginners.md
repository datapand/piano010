I have developed my own teaching method that accelerates the initial learning process.

It has been tested and proven effective, specifically designed to teach beginners how to read 'all notes' with 'both hands' in a shorter time frame. (Most beginner students will admit to struggling with reading the bass clef, in other words, with their left hand.)

This is not just a claim; it is the result of extensive experience gained over many years of teaching with highly respected method books in music schools.

In a typical training context, approximately 40 lessons per school year are needed to teach the basics to an average student over 12 years old when traditional method books are the primary resources.

However, the unique material I have developed can teach these fundamentals in just 8 to 12 lessons, and it also covers topics from second-year books, equivalent to an additional 40 lessons.


## The Principles

Learning to play the piano can be quite a task. It takes time and patience, and it's not always clear where to start.

Of course, making music at any level is enjoyable. But why not take it to the next level?

Throughout my 22 years as a teacher, I have dedicated all my time to helping people reach higher levels of complexity in piano education.

I strongly believe that with the right guidance, people can achieve higher goals, and I have demonstrated many times that amateurs can acquire skills comparable to those of professionals.


## The Methodology

After using the most frequently used piano teaching books on the market in my lessons for nine years (30 to 40 students weekly) and eight years prior, I realized new material has to be developed. The methodical books that traditional teachers in many conservatories use and advise young teachers to use are pretty old if you look at their publishing years.

The world has changed, and the methods have to be updated. Unfortunately, in this sector, few people care and dare to broaden their view of the educative styles of the modern world.
You can find my early findings through my research and tests on students. Both hands notes reading success rate starts from 82%.

The material expels old teaching methods, adds modern cognitive learning techniques, takes beginners to the next level faster without relying on self-practice, and helps keep the knowledge solid and durable.
â€‹
- Old Teaching Methods: <br> The old teaching method was to teach students what to play, not how to think about what to play.
- Modern Learning Techniques: <br> Nowadays, people learn differently than they did in the past. Instead of being taught what to play, students today are taught what to think about what to play.
