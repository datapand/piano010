I consider myself fortunate to recognize the potential in young students, and to dedicate efforts toward helping them reach advanced levels-especially those who might have been overlooked or held back by traditional teaching approaches. Through calculated risks taken after establishing essential foundations, students have been able to bypass certain repertoire strategically, saving valuable time. 

Several of my talented long-term students have gone on to pursue higher education at the university level, gaining admission to conservatories that have paved their way to becoming professional pianists. Others have reached a master's level, even if they chose different career paths. You can find some testimonials on my artist web page.
