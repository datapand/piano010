Since the Corona period, I no longer teach at music schools and now give all lessons exclusively at my own piano studio. Located in Rotterdam Centrum, the studio welcomes students from across the region-Dordrecht, Gouda, Den Haag, Delft, Rhoon, Capelle, Barendrecht, Schiedam, Vlaardingen, and all neighborhoods of Rotterdam, including Kralingen, Hillegersberg, Schiebroek, Noord, West, Oost, and Zuid.

Not having to travel between schools has saved me around 10 hours each week, which means I am more energetic for those who come to my studio and can offer much greater flexibility in scheduling lessons.
