_I present the pieces between “beginner” and “intermediate level” as options so that students can prevent further difficulties._

This repertoire is, unfortunately, under-listed by many educational programs, book series, or online platforms. As many certified and experienced classical piano teachers will agree, most lists that claim to offer repertoire at this level are actually more suitable for intermediate students. In light of the missing and incorrect information, I wanted to create a book that piano teachers can also benefit from.

Piano teachers who are not actual pianists (many piano teachers are not trained pianists; they are often other instrumentalists or singers who can play piano) or those who do not have much time to research repertoire often conduct lessons using only the books or popular songs available to them. I hope this book can help both them and their students, since it includes instructions on what to teach and learn.
