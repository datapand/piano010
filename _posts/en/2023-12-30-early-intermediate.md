## What should you explore between the beginners and intermediate level?

​I create a series of videos on my YouTube channel to help those in need of early intermediate piano repertoire.

## Stuck?

_“I have been playing the piano for years, but I have not been able to progress for a while. Why am I stuck? How can I improve?”_

Those students came to my classes without realizing they had complicated technical problems when moving to intermediate-level pieces. They have taken lessons for years and loved playing the piano. But difficulties lead to a lack of motivation. 

They often become frustrated when they learn that they need to correct their technique or do not know what to do.

> **It takes patience to make up for years of missing theoretical or style knowledge by lowering the level of pieces and learning the proper techniques.**

## Curation

_I present the pieces between “beginner” and “intermediate level” as options so that students can prevent further difficulties._

This repertoire is, unfortunately, under-listed by many educational programs, book series, or online platforms. Many top-up lists, which seem to be repertoire at this level, are, in fact, higher level; Intermediate. Among the missing and wrong information, I wanted to make a list that piano teachers can also benefit from.

Because the piano teachers who are not actually pianists or do not have much time to research, they conduct the lessons with books or popular songs available to them. I hope this list can help them and their students as well.
